# BirthdaysBot

This [Telegram bot](https://t.me/iCalBirthdaysBot) is a brilliant little example of how a simple iCal parser will make you a better human being. Seriously.

Ok, if we're being *serious* serious, this bot will actually just send you notifications about your friends' birthdays. Which, in part, will make you a better human being, *if* you decide to act on the notification.

## Why, even?

Primarily, because [Google Calendar users can't enable notifications for Birthdays calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/thread/1699815?hl=en&msgid=1714805). Don't ask yourself why a multi-trillion dollar corporation doesn't give this option to its users. You will not know.

## How do I use the bot?

Quite easily. Just send an `.ics` file to the bot.

Keep in mind: the bot itself provides no interface for interacting with Birthday information. If you want to change something, be it someone's name, date of birth *(who knows, you do you)*, or you want to add new Birhdays, do the changes in the calendar.

First, change or add info in the calendar. Then export the calendar. Then re-upload the `.ics` file to the bot.

## How do I get the ICS file?

You have a couple of options.

### [Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37111?hl=en)
1. Go to [Google Calendar's website](https://calendar.google.com/calendar) and log in.
    - Use the desktop version; mobile app does not support exporting calendars
2. Open Settings in the top right corner.
3. Navigate to "Import & export" tab and click "Export".
4. You will get a ZIP archive containing separate `.ics` files for each of the calendars

### macOS native Calendar.App
1. In the Calendar List, pick a calendar you'd like to export.
2. File --> Export --> Export...
3. Export. Done.

## Wanna host this bot yourself?

> BirthdaysBot imports birthdays into a local SQLite file to schedule notifications
>
> This data will be kept **private and secure**, never given to third parties or used for any other purposes than notificating you
>
> However, if you don't feel comfortable entrusting me with this data â€” host your own bot

1. Clone this repository
    - ``git clone https://github.com/MrGauz/BirthdaysBot.git``
2. Create a Telegram bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
    - After bot is registered you'll get an API token, use it in the next step
    - **Keep API token a secret!**
3. Make a copy of ``.env.example`` and name it ``.env``
    - Put the API token into the ``.env``
4. [Install .NET Runtime 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0)
    - Alternatively, you can use the [.NET Runtime 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0)
5. Build the project, compiled code can be found in ``bin/Release/net5.0/``
    - ``dotnet build -c Release``
    - Make sure ``.env`` was copied to the folder with compiled code
6. Run your bot
    - ``dotnet bin/Release/net5.0/BirthdaysBot.dll``
7. ???
8. PROFIT

## (Possible) future plans

Let's be frank: it's open source Telegram bot. Most likely it'll be surving it's purpose for as long as it should, but it won't become a multi-million dollar startup.

However, there are a couple of ideas that might be implemented in the future. Or not. See the paragraph above.

- [ ] Support adding birthdays from contacts' list
- [ ] Instructions on how to export calendars from more platforms
- [ ] Configure notifications time
- [ ] Let users add/remove Birthdays right from the Telegram bot UI without importing `.ics`
- [ ] Turn this into a bank
